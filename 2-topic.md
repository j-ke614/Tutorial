# Sets

    - Data structure that can store any number unique values. 
    - Differnt from arrays in that they only allow non-repeated values.

Sets are a data structure that doesnt care about order. They also do not accept duplicate data values. This data structure uses a technique called hashing to add, remove, and check to see if there is already and existing value in the set, very quickly. 
The Set operations are as follows:

- add(value)  >>> adds a value to the set.
- remove(value) >>> removes a value from the set.
- member(value) >>> check is the value is in the set.
- size() >>> returns the number of items in the set.

These Operations allows us to build and manipulate the data within the set to fulfill our needs.

## Problem

Now try to write a simple program that will take numbers in a set and add them together and give you the answer, a simple calculator.
